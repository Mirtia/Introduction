# Red Team

## Overview / What is it?

Red teaming bridges military adversarial tactics with cybersecurity, simulating real threats to test defenses. It translates special operations strategies—like OPFOR (Opposing Force) exercises—into cyber practices, especially Capture the Flag (CTF) games. These CTFs mimic hacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, Procedures) from frameworks like [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/), creating narrative-driven scenarios with “fog of war” uncertainty to train ethical hacking skills.

## Real World Applications & Relevance

In cybersecurity, red teaming uncovers vulnerabilities in networks, just as military drills prepare troops for battle. It’s used by governments (e.g., U.S. DoD simulations) and companies (e.g., Google’s Project Zero) to emulate APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). Relevance: Builds cyber resilience, improves incident response, and trains defenders against real attacks like ransomware or supply-chain breaches.

Recent cyber threats highlight global espionage as a “world game,” where adversaries shift from social engineering to highly technical tactics—like AiTM (adversary-in-the-middle) attacks—to achieve strategic objectives, embodying red teaming principles of simulating real TTPs for training and resilience.
	
* **July 2025**: Russian FSB-linked hackers (Secret Blizzard) exploited ISP access in Moscow to target embassies with AiTM, deploying ApolloShadow malware via fake Kaspersky updates for long-term spying.

* **August 2025**: Hackers exploited Microsoft SharePoint flaws to breach Fermilab, stealing sensitive research data and underscoring vulnerabilities in scientific infrastructure.

* **2025 Trends**: China’s tactics evolve from lasers to deepfakes in hybrid warfare, blending physical and cyber ops for influence campaigns.

* **Ongoing** : Fake game installers target Middle East’s $7B gaming market, distributing malware disguised as popular titles to compromise users.

These examples show red teaming in action: transforming social lures into technical exploits mirrors military OPFOR strategies, urging defenders to emulate such TTPs in CTFs for better preparedness.

## Challenges

Now its your time soldier, let's start the **Cellular Recon** Project:

- **Wardriving Lite**: Use free apps like Wigle WiFi or Network Survey on your phone to map nearby Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular signals. Can you geolocate yourself using only Wi-Fi names? Simulates passive reconnaissance without hacking.


- **Signal Hunt Challenge**: Walk around, log strongest Wi-Fi spots, and hypothesize “attack vectors” (e.g., open networks). Share maps in group—feels like fog-of-war intel gathering.

The world is full of opportunities to think differently — but you’ll need allies for the journey! Come visit our **DTU Hacker Lab**, where curious minds like yours gather to learn, collaborate, and tackle projects together.
